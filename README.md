Getting the number of swap and compare of Bubble, Selection and Insertion Sorting

<br>

## Additional Context

**Bubble Sort** is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.

The **Selection Sort** algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order) from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array.

1) The subarray which is already sorted.
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of Selection Sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.

**Insertion Sort** is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands.
